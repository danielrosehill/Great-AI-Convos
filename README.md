# A Few Great AI Convos

Thie repository contains one (or perhaps in the future more than one!) conversation(s) with AI tools. 

Each interaction is date-stamped and, where relevant, includes the system prompt used with conversational modelsâ€”most likely ChatGPT but if I manage to add more other. These dialogues are preserved as a snapshot of AI capabilities at specific points in time.

In the past, I created an extensive library of AI prompts and outputs. This collection is a more curated version of those conversations.

My motivations for occasionally capturing LLM chats for posterity varies: sometimes it's part of my ongoing project to extract personal context data for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) from conversation histories. Other times, I'm simply fascinated by documenting what AI was like through real, not synthetic, conversations.

## Prompts and STT translated

For the past six months, I've primarily used voice-to-text as my main mode of interacting with computer systems. 

This shift has significantly changed how I experience and utilize AI tools like live ChatGPT. 

Although this repository uses a text-to-text interface, all prompts are captured through dictation. 

Consequently, my prompts may feel more disorganized and unstructured than they would had I typed them and the train of logic might be, at times, hard to follow. However, this method allows me to easily add contextual data to my prompts, which I believe is crucial for success with AI. After all, it's not really a conversation with a sentient being but rather an interaction with a predictive algorithm that can be guided to provide useful information!

Other than occasional minimal redcation of PII and the addition of paragraphs to break up the otherwise continuous blocks of STT text, no editing has been done - of either side of the conversation.

There is no particular structure offered here; these records are available for anyone who wishes to use them.
